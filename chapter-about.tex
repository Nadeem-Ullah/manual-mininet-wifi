\chapter{About Mininet-WiFi}

Mininet-WiFi is a fork of the Mininet SDN network emulator and extended the functionality of Mininet by adding virtualized WiFi stations and access points based on the standard Linux wireless drivers and the 80211\_hwsim wireless simulation driver. We added classes to support the addition of these wireless devices in a Mininet network scenario and to emulate the attributes of a mobile station such as position and movement relative to the access points.

The Mininet-WiFi extended the base Mininet code by adding or modifying classes and scripts. So, Mininet-WiFi adds new functionality and still supports all the normal SDN emulation capabilities of the standard Mininet network emulator.

    wifi:~$ util/install.sh -h
\end{minted}

\subsection{Docker}\index{docker}
Mininet-WiFi is available on \underline{\href{https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/ramonfontes/mininet-wifi/}{Docker}}\footnote{https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/ramonfontes/mininet-wifi/}.

\section{Limitations}\index{limitations}
Mininet-WiFi inherits all limitations of Mininet, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item You cannot handle with packets that go out to the incoming port with the OpenFlow protocol.
\end{itemize}

\section{Architecture and Components}\index{arch}

The main components that make part of the development of Mininet-WiFi are illustrated in Figure~\ref{flowchart}. In the kernel-space the module \textit{mac80211\_hwsim} is responsible for creating virtual Wi-Fi interfaces, important for stations and access points. Continuing in the kernel-space, MLME (\textit{Media Access Control Sublayer Management Entity})\footnote{some of the functions performed by MLME are authentication, association, sending and receiving \textit{beacons}, etc.}  is realized in the stations side, while in the user-space the \textit{hostapd} is responsible  for this task in the AP side.

Mininet-WiFi also uses a couple utilities such as \textit{iw}, \textit{iwconfig} e o \textit{wpa\_supplicant}. The first two are used for interface configuration and for getting information from wireless interfaces and the last one is used with \textit{Hostapd}, in order to support WPA (\textit{Wi-Fi Protected Access}), among other things. Besides them, another fundamental utility is \textit{TC} (\textit{Traffic Control}). The \textit{TC} is an user-space utility program used to configure the Linux kernel packet scheduler, responsible for controlling the rate, delay, latency and loss, applying these attributes in virtual interfaces of stations and APs, representing with higher fidelity the behavior of the real world.

\caption{Components and connections in a two-host network created with Mininet-WiFi.}
\label{fig:arch}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:arch} depicts the components and connections in a simple topology with two stations (or hosts) created with Mininet-WiFi, where the newly implemented components (highlighted in gray) are presented along the original Mininet building blocks. Although stations are equipped with a wireless interface by default they are able to connect with access points through wired links (veth pairs) as well.  

More specifically, we added WiFi interfaces on stations that now are able to connect to an access point through its (\texttt{wlanX}) interface that is bridged to an OpenFlow switch with AP capabilities represented by (\texttt{ap1}). 
Similar to Mininet, the virtual network is created by placing host processes in Linux OS network namespaces interconnected through virtual Ethernet (veth) pairs. The wireless interfaces to virtualize WiFi devices work on \textit{master} mode for access points and \textit{managed} mode for stations.

\noindent \textbf{Stations:} Are devices that connect to an access point through authentication and association. In our implementation, each station has one wireless card (\texttt{staX-wlan0} - where X shall be replaced by the number of each station). Since the traditional Mininet hosts are connected to an access point, stations are able to communicate with those hosts.

\noindent \textbf{Access Points:} Are devices that manage associated stations. Virtualized through \texttt{hostapd}\footnote{Hostapd (\textbf{H}ost \textbf{A}ccess \textbf{P}oint \textbf{D}aemon) user space software capable of turning normal wireless network interface cards into access points and authentication servers} daemon and use virtual wireless interfaces for access point and authentication servers. 
While virtualized access points do not have (yet) APIs allowing users to configure several parameters in the same fashion of a real one, the current implementation covers the most important features, for example ssid, channel, mode, password, cryptography, etc.

Both stations and access points use \texttt{cfg80211} to communicate with the wireless device driver, a Linux 802.11 configuration API that provides communication between stations and \texttt{mac80211}. This framework in turn communicates directly with the WiFi device driver through a \texttt{netlink} socket (or more specifically \texttt{nl80211}) that is used to configure the \texttt{cfg80211} device and for kernel-user-space communication as well.

\section{Creating Network}\index{creatingNetwork}

You can create a simple network (2 stations and 1 access point) with the following command:
\begin{minted}{bash}
    sudo mn --wifi
\end{minted}

\noindent The command above can be utilized with other parameters, like in:
\begin{minted}{bash}
    sudo mn --wifi --ssid=new_ssid --mode=g --channel=1
\end{minted}

\noindent You can also use just mn if you want to work only with Mininet instead of Mininet-WiFi.

\subsection{Changing Topology Size and Type}\index{topo}
The default topology is a single Access Point connected to two Stations. You could change this to a different topo with --topo and pass parameters for that topologyâ€™s creation. For example, to verify all-pairs ping connectivity with one Access Point and five Stations:
\begin{minted}{bash}
    sudo mn --wifi --test pingall --topo single,5
\end{minted}

\noindent Another example, with a linear topology (where each Access Point has one station, and all Access Points connect in a line via wired media):
\begin{minted}{bash}
    sudo mn --wifi --test pingall --topo linear,5
\end{minted}

\subsection{Examples}\index{examples}
If you are just beginning to write scripts for Mininet-WiFi, you can use the example scripts as a starting point. We created example scripts in the \texttt{~/mininet-wifi/examples} directory that show how to use most of the features in Mininet-WiFi.

\section{Supported Features}

\subsection{Encryption}\index{encryption}
Mininet-WiFi supports WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy), WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) and WPA2.

\subsubsection{Static WEP key configuration}
The key length should be 5, 13, or 16 characters (for ASCII WEP key), or 10, 26, or 32 digits (for hex WEP key), depending on whether 40-bit (64-bit), 104-bit (128-bit), or 128-bit (152-bit) WEP is used.

\subsection{Support to IEEE 802.11r}\index{80211r}

The example below enables 802.11r.

\begin{minted}[breaklines]{bash}
    ap1 = net.addAccessPoint( 'ap1', ssid="simplewifi", mode="g", channel="6", passwd='123456789a', encrypt='wpa2', ieee80211r='yes', mobility_domain='a1b2'
\end{minted}

\subsection{Support to bgscan (Background scanning)}\index{bgscan}

\texttt{wpa\_supplicant} behavior for background scanning can be specified by configuring a bgscan module. These modules are responsible for requesting background scans for the purpose of roaming within an ESS (i.e., within a single network block with all the APs using the same SSID). You can enable bgscan calling setBgscan(), for example:

\begin{minted}[breaklines]{bash}
    net.setBgscan()
\end{minted}
or
\begin{minted}[breaklines]{bash}
    net.setBgscan(module="$module_name", s_inverval=$value, signal=$value, l_interval=$value, database=$dir)
\end{minted}


\noindent s\_interval: \textit{short bgscan interval in seconds} \\
signal: \textit{signal strength threshold} \\
l\_interval: \textit{long interval} \\
database: \textit{<database file name>}

\noindent source: \url{https://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/plain/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf}

\subsection{Interference}\index{interference}
Mininet-WiFi supports the interference model provided by wmediumd. An example about how to enable interference is given below.

\begin{minted}[breaklines]{bash}
    net = Mininet( ... useWmediumd=True, enable_interference=True )
\end{minted}

The interference model implemented in wmediumd relies on CCA THRESHOLD (Clear Channel Assessment). The CCA is used by the MAC layer to determine (i) if the channel is clear for transmitting data, and (ii) for determining when there is incoming data. Evaluation of CCA is made by the PHY layer and the resulting assessment is communicated to the MAC layer via the PHY-CCA.indicate service primitive. This primitive can either be set to IDLE, when the channel is assessed to be clear, or BUSY when the channel is assessed to be in use.

%\textit{Wmediumd's rate table is currently hardcoded to IEEE 802.11a OFDM rates. Therefore, either operate wmediumd networks in 5 GHz channels, or supply a rateset for the BSS with no CCK rates.}

\subsection{Multiple SSIDs over a single AP}\index{multiplessid}
An unique AP supports up to 8 different SSIDs. You can configure multiple SSIDs separating different ssids by commas when you add an AP. For example:

\begin{minted}[breaklines]{bash}
    ap1 = net.addAccessPoint( 'ap1', ssid="ssid1,ssid2,ssid3", mode="g", channel="1" )
\end{minted}

\subsection{Support to WDS}\index{wds}
Wireless Distribution System (WDS) is supported by Mininet-WiFi with minor changes in mac80211\_hwsim. Further details about how to do these changes are available at \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a27qWHO8JDM}

\subsection{Including RSSI in the packet header}\index{rssi}
Although beacons can be captured using any packet sniffer, changes on the RSSI by the propagation models in place are
not included in the packet header by default. Minor changes are required in mac80211\_hwsim in order to fix this issue. Further details are available at: \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtaHCpaHBGc}

\subsection{Support to Virtual Interfaces}\index{vifs}

The mac80211 subsystem in the linux kernel supports multiple wireless interfaces to be created with one physical wireless card. To do so you have to set the number of virtual interfaces to be created (nvif), as illustrated below.

\begin{minted}[breaklines]{bash}
    sta1 = net.addStation( 'sta1', nvif=2 )
\end{minted}

\subsection{Customizing Equations}\index{equation}
When a node is moving different values for bandwidth, latency, loss and delay are applied based on equations. Those equations can be customized by calling setChannelEquation(), for example:

\begin{minted}[breaklines]{bash}
#dist = distance between receiver and transmitter
#custombw = is a default value for bw which takes into account the RSSI
    net.setChannelEquation(bw='value.rate * (1.1 ** -dist)', loss='(dist * 2) / 100', delay='(dist / 10) + 1', latency='2 + dist')
\end{minted}

\subsection{Integration with Intermediate Functional Block (IFB) Devices}\index{ifb}\label{ifb}

Intermediate Functional Block (IFB) is an alternative to tc filters for handling ingress traffic, by redirecting it to a virtual interface and treat is as egress traffic. IFB is supported by calling net.useIFB() just after adding all nodes and before calling net.configureWifiNodes().
\\
Further information about IFB is available at \url{http://shorewall.net/traffic\_shaping.htm\#IFB}.



\subsection{Integration with wmediumd}\index{wmediumd}\label{wmediumd}
The kernel module mac80211\_hwsim uses the same virtual medium for all wireless nodes. This means all nodes are internally in range of each other and they can be discovered in a wireless scan on the virtual interfaces. Mininet-WiFi simulates their position and wireless ranges by assigning stations to other stations or access points and revoking these wireless associations. If wireless interfaces should be isolated from each other (e.g. in adhoc or mesh networks) a tool like \underline{\href{https://github.com/bcopeland/wmediumd}{wmediumd}}\footnote{https://github.com/bcopeland/wmediumd} is required. It uses a kind of a dispatcher to permit or deny the transfer of packets from one interface to another.\\
\\
Mininet-WiFi contains a small helper that should support when using wmediumd. It is located in \texttt{wmediumdConnector.py}. Two modes can be used when using this connector: dynamic and static mode.

\subsubsection{Dynamic mode}
This mode should be the best choice in most use cases. It requires the input of Mininet interfaces as Python objects and retrieves the MAC addresses which are required for wmediumd automatically from the Mininet API.\\
%\textbf{Please have in mind:} Even though it is called dynamic mode it does not mean that changes to the MAC addresses will be directed to wmediumd. Once it is initialized the configuration cannot be changed anymore which implies this is not suitable for mobility and manual position or range changes etc.\\
\\
At first you have to enter the connection properties for wmediumd. The following code snippet would create a linear topology in which sta1 can reach sta2, sta2 can reach sta3 (and vice versa) but sta1 can't reach sta3 directly.
\begin{minted}[breaklines]{bash}
sta1wlan0 = DynamicWmediumdIntfRef(sta1)
sta2wlan0 = DynamicWmediumdIntfRef(sta2)
sta3wlan0 = DynamicWmediumdIntfRef(sta3)

intfrefs = [sta1wlan0, sta2wlan0, sta3wlan0]
links = [
  WmediumdLink(sta1wlan0, sta2wlan0, 15),
  WmediumdLink(sta2wlan0, sta1wlan0, 15),
  WmediumdLink(sta2wlan0, sta3wlan0, 15),
  WmediumdLink(sta3wlan0, sta2wlan0, 15)]
WmediumdConn.set_wmediumd_data(intfrefs, links)
\end{minted}
The variables \texttt{staX-wlan0} are references to interfaces of Mininet-WiFi stations. If only the station is provided in the constructor, the default interface will be used. Other interfaces can be specified by adding an extra parameter containing the name of the interface.\\
The variable \texttt{intfrefs} has to contain all interfaces that should be monitored by wmediumd. If an interface is present in the link list, but not in the \texttt{intfrefs} list, an exception will be raised.\\
\texttt{links} has to contain all pairs of interfaces that should be able to reach the other one. Note: this can be asymmetrical, for example packets from sta1wlan0 could reach sta2wlan0 but not vice versa. If you want the connections to be symmetrical both pairs have to be present. The third parameter is the signal-noise-ratio which is used by wmediumd to simulate packet loss. Packet loss depends on the packet size and TX rate.\\
\\
If the Mininet-WiFi network is already started use the following method to start wmediumd:
\begin{minted}[breaklines]{bash}
WmediumdConn.connect_wmediumd_after_startup()
\end{minted}
%An example is located in \texttt{examples/wmediumd\_ibss\_dynamic.py}.\\
%\\
This has the disadvantage that some tools like \texttt{iw} use a cache and the stations previously discovered may appear even if they cannot be reached anymore.\\
To prevent this you can use another method:
\begin{minted}[breaklines]{bash}
WmediumdConn.connect_wmediumd_on_startup()
\end{minted}
This will hook into Mininet-WiFi and will start wmediumd right after the mac80211\_hwsim module is initialized. The method has to be called between the creation of stations (because the station objects are required) and before the net is started or any wireless associations are done.\\
\\
An example is located in \texttt{examples/wmediumd\_ibss\_dynamic\_intercept.py}.
\\
Consider to take examples/wmediumd\_mobility.py as example if you want to work with mobility.

\subsubsection{Static mode}
The static mode uses the MAC addresses that have been provided. In most cases the dynamic mode is the one to use. The advantage of the static mode is that no station objects are required and the data could be provided prior to the start of Mininet-WiFi.
\begin{minted}[breaklines]{bash}
sta1wlan0 = StaticWmediumdIntfRef('sta1', 'sta1-wlan0', '02:00:00:00:00:00')
sta2wlan0 = StaticWmediumdIntfRef('sta2', 'sta2-wlan0', '02:00:00:00:01:00')
sta3wlan0 = StaticWmediumdIntfRef('sta3', 'sta3-wlan0', '02:00:00:00:02:00')

intfrefs = [sta1wlan0, sta2wlan0, sta3wlan0]
links = [
  WmediumdLink(sta1wlan0, sta2wlan0, 15),
  WmediumdLink(sta2wlan0, sta1wlan0, 15),
  WmediumdLink(sta2wlan0, sta3wlan0, 15),
  WmediumdLink(sta3wlan0, sta2wlan0, 15)]
WmediumdConn.set_wmediumd_data(intfrefs, links)
\end{minted}
Station and interface names don't need to match real stations and real interfaces. They are just used to create an identifier that is used internally. The combination of station and interface name has to be unique.\\
\\
After the data is set, wmediumd can be started just like in dynamic mode.\\
\\
An example is located in \texttt{examples/wmediumd\_ibss\_static.py}.

\subsubsection{Installation of wmediumd}
It is required that wmediumd can be called using the command \texttt{wmediumd}. That means it should be located in \texttt{/usr/bin} or any other path that is available through the PATH enviroment variable.\\
wmediumd can be automatically installed using the \texttt{-l} option on \texttt{util/install.sh}. This will copy the binary to \texttt{/usr/bin/wmediumd}.

\section{FAQ}\index{faq}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Question:} \textit{I am getting the following Error message:} \textbf{IndexError: list index out of range}. \textit{How to solve it?}\\
\textit{Answer:}
\begin{minted}{bash}
    sudo mn -c
\end{minted}
\item \textit{Question:} Is it possible to create a wired link between station and ap?\\
\textit{Answer:} Yes. When you add a link between station and ap you have to add the parameter link='wired' (e.g. net.addLink(sta1, ap2, link='wired')\\

\item \textit{May I customize the Access Point and Station configuration file?}
\\
\textit{Answer:} Since the Access Point is based on Hostapd you may customize the configuration file generated by Mininet-WiFi adding the parameter \texttt{config} when you create the access point, for example:\\

\begin{minted}[breaklines]{bash}
    ap1 = net.addAccessPoint( 'ap1', config='ctrl_interface=/var/run/hostapd/,ctrl_interface_group=0' )
\end{minted}

The code above will create the file ap1-wlan1.apconf. \\

The same can be done for stations when wpa\_supplicant is used, for example:

\begin{minted}[breaklines]{bash}
    sta1 = net.addStation( 'sta1', config='eap=PEAP,identity="bob"' )
\end{minted}


\item \textit{Is it possible to plot hosts in graph?}
Yes, it is possible. You have to call the method below before creating any link between two nodes with addLink():

\begin{minted}[breaklines]{bash}
    net.plotNode(h1, position='10,10,0')
\end{minted}
\end{itemize}
